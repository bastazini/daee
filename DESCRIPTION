Description: Set of functions for analysis of ecological and evolutionary
    data. These functions calculate Phylogenetic Eigenvector Regression (PVR)
    with eigenvector selection, extract residuals from Mantel test and generate
    Linear Models (LM) with all possible combinations of variables included in
    the full model. The functions are available as an R package only to facilitate
    installation.
